# F# Tour

A guided interactive tour of the F# language.

## Development

### Prerequisites
* .NET 8.0
* NodeJS (npm)

### Running the Application
```
dotnet fsi build.fsx -- -p Setup
npm start

## Inspirations
- Originally based on the [Gleam Language Tour](https://tour.gleam.run) and the [Kotlin Tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-welcome.html)
- The core logic for compiling F# in the browser is based on the work done in the [Fable REPL](https://github.com/fable-compiler/repl).
